    <p>These crypto-tools are inspired by Dan Boneh's crypto 1 class. (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/">View it on Coursera</a>)</p>

    <p>They are written in javascript and are available for education and fun. I wouldn't recommend using them for real-world cryptographic purposes, but you can #DoWhatchaWant. Here are some <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/august/javascript-cryptography-considered-harmful/">security considerations</a> about javacsript-based crypto. I think these tools are exempt because they are 100% client-side, but it's still an interesting read.</p>
